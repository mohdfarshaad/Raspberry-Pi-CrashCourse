# ROS 2 with Raspberry Pi

This document introduces **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)** and shows how it can be used on Raspberry Pi for robotics, IoT, and automation projects.

## ðŸš€ What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a **framework for building robotic applications**. It helps you connect different parts of a system (sensors, motors, cameras, web apps, AI models) through **nodes** and **topics**.

* **Node** â†’ A program that does one task (e.g., read a sensor, control a motor)
* **Topic** â†’ A communication channel where nodes share data
* **Publisher** â†’ Sends messages (e.g., sensor data)
* **Subscriber** â†’ Receives messages (e.g., motor controller)
